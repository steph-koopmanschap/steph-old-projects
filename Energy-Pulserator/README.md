## Rules of the energy field:

- The energy field is composed of a grid. And each point in the grid is called a "Pulser".
- At the start. Each Pulser has a random energy level assigned from 0 to 9.
- If a Pulser has 0 energy it is black.
- If a Pulser has less than 5 energy it is green.
- If a Pulser has more than 5 energy, but less than 10 energy it is yellow.
- If a Pulser has more than 10 energy it is red.
- When a Pulser has more than 10 energy it will create a pulse every second which <br /> 
    increases the energy of every Pulser directly around it by either 1 and decreases its own energy by the energy loss per pulse factor <br />
    It also turns white momentarily.   
- Pressing the "PULSE" button increases the energy of every Pulser in the grid by 1.
- Pressing the "LOCAL PULSE" button increases the energy of a random pulsr in the field by 1.
- Pressing the "RESET" button resets the energy field to point 2.
