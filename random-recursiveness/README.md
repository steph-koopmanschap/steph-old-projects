# random-recursiveness
This program generates 2 random numbers between Minium and Maximum. Then draws a circle the radius of the difference between the 2 numbers.
It then generates another 2 randon numbers between the previous 2 numbers and draws another circle the radius of the difference.
This continues until the circle will be too small to be drawn or until it runs out of specified iterations.
The positions of the circle (x,y) are equal to the 2 random numbers
